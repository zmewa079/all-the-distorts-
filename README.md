# all-the-things

## Your task for today!

Each member of your team should add the following items to this project, following the GitHub Group Workflow Document:

1. A piece of state to the state object in `App.js`. For example:

```javascript
[
  {
    name: "functional programming",
    image: "https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/functional.png",  
    attributes: ["efficient", "reusability", "not a taco", "beautiful"],
  },
  {
    name: "React hooks",
    image: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1518644730709-0835105d9daa?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1950&q=80",
    attributes: ["useEffect", "useState", "not a taco", "state's best friend"], 
  },
  ...
]
```

2. Add a new component. This component will live inside it's own directory in the `Pages` directory, just like the existing `XxxxxxxThings.jsx` files inside the `XxxxxxxThings` directories. Name the component appropriately, it will be used to iterate over the things you put into state in step one and display them inside of the ThingCard component. Your `XxxxxxxThings.jsx` file will look similar to this, changing names where appropriate:
  
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ThingCard from '../../components/ThingCard/ThingCard'
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom'

const StyledThings = (props) => {
  return (
    <>
      <Link to="/">Home</Link>

      {props.things.map((thing, idx) => 
        <ThingCard key={idx} thing={thing}/>
      )}
    </>
  )
}

export default StyledThings
```

3. Add a link to your new component inside of `Home.jsx` alongside the existing links:

```javascript
  <>
    {/* All the <a> tags should live here */}
    <h1>All-The-Things</h1>
    <Link to="/the-functional-things">Shahzad's Things</Link><br/>
    <Link to="/the-well-styled-things">David's Things</Link><br/>
  </>
```

4. Make a new route that points to the new link you just made, and displays the component you just created (don't forget to import the component you just made!) It should look something like this:

```javascript
<Route path='/your-new-link-here' element={<XxxxxxxThings things={xxxxxxxThings} />} />
```

After you have completed these steps follow the steps in the GitHub Group Workflow Document to create a pull request into the Git Commander's repo for the project. The Git Commander should then approve/deny the changes and merge them into the main branch*.  When that is done, group members should pull any additional changes down to their local repository's main branch.


**(*  We're keeping this example simple, as it is probably your first time seeing this type of workflow.  Ideally, you'd merge the pull requests into a dev branch to test the added feature's functionality, then if the app functions as intended, the changes should then be merged into the main branch.  This is more like what you'll see when you're out in the real world, as you'll likely never be merging changes directly into a main branch of an app that's in production.)**
